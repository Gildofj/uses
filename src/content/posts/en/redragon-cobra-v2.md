So far, this has been the best mouse I've ever had. It has a DPI of up to 12400, making it very precise for games that demand higher accuracy, such as FPS games. The two side buttons are quite handy during gameplay. It has a comfortable and ergonomic shape, considering the standards for this mouse category, and comes at a very affordable price. And the best part, it has RGB lighting! 😂
