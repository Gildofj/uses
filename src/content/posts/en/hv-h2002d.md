I've had several other headsets throughout my life, but this one has proven to have the best cost-benefit ratio so far. It has excellent finishing, is very comfortable, and boasts great sound quality both for input and output, of course.

As a downside, I personally didn't like the decision for it to have a removable microphone with a standard audio jack, the same as traditional headphone inputs. Despite the convenience of using the microphone only when needed, this opens up many opportunities for both the microphone and headphone jacks to wear out or start experiencing connectivity issues.
