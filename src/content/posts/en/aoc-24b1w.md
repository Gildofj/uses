Currently, this is the monitor I use as my primary display. I find it to be excellent in terms of cost-benefit, considering its features like up to 75Hz refresh rate, 24 inches in size, and full HD resolution. It has a great size, allowing for easy separation into two windows without space issues, significantly improving my day-to-day productivity. So far, it's perfect for my daily use.

Another crucial point for me is its excellent performance in gaming, with a very sharp image even though it's not a top-of-the-line monitor.
