Being an avid gamer, especially in competitive games, I've always had an interest in getting a mechanical keyboard. After some time, I found this one, which was a great cost-effective choice at the time. Over time, I discovered that aside from being great for gaming, mechanical keyboards also make typing much more comfortable. It turned out to be the perfect match for a peripheral useful for both leisure and work.

Of course, at the time of purchase, I didn't pay attention to certain details due to my lack of knowledge on the subject. After a while, I realized that the numeric keypad on the side took up unnecessary space for me since I don't use it much in my daily tasks, and it makes the keyboard quite large. Another point is that this keyboard has Outemu clicky switches, known for being budget switches with a reputation for not performing well in the long run. The keycaps are made of ABS plastic, which is not the most durable, considering PBT plastic is more resistant.

Certainly, not everything was negative. As mentioned, the product had an excellent cost-benefit ratio at the time, and this perception persists to this day. One notable advantage is the hot-swappable capability, allowing for the convenient exchange of switches. The issue associated with Outemu switches can be easily addressed with this feature.

Furthermore, I highlight the quality of the finish and keys, which remain remarkably well-crafted. The doubleshot keys, for instance, are an excellent addition, preventing wear due to constant use. The aluminum finish not only contributes to the aesthetics but also provides a more robust and durable keyboard structure.
