Opting for a desktop computer instead of a laptop, I encountered the absence of a built-in webcam. Accustomed to having all the necessary features in my old laptop, I only then realized the importance of this component.

Although the webcam is not an essential peripheral for my daily routine, I acknowledge its usefulness in certain situations, such as meetings or job interviews where showing one's face is beneficial. With that in mind, I conducted extensive research and chose this Logitech product, which has proven to be excellent so far. With image quality up to 1080p Full HD, it provides a clear and sharp image during calls and meetings.

So far, the only negative aspect I've noticed is that, during longer meetings, the webcam tends to overheat, resulting in lens fogging. However, I'm not sure if this is due to some specific configuration on my part or if it's a flaw in the product itself.
