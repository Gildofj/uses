This laptop is not actually mine; it's the computer provided by my company for day-to-day tasks. However, I use it only when I need to work outside of my home, considering that my personal laptop has a better configuration, making my everyday work more productive. Nevertheless, this doesn't make this equipment inadequate. Currently, I've been primarily working with mobile development, specifically native Android. Therefore, I use Android Studio daily, which requires a more powerful computer than the usual, as any configuration must be capable of handling development and testing processes smoothly without performance issues or bottlenecks.

One feature I really appreciate about it is the keyboard, which comes with backlighting and is very comfortable for typing. This eliminates the need for an external keyboard if you prefer not to use one, making it much more convenient for use in places where you can't set up an elaborate workstation. Other noteworthy features, while not influencing my daily work significantly, include excellent and loud built-in speakers, a fantastic webcam with a built-in lens blocker for privacy-conscious users, a full HD screen, and a great and smooth touchpad.
