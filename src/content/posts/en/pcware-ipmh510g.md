Currently, I work as a full-stack developer, and often, I need to run multiple programs simultaneously or even run resource-intensive programs like Android Studio, which, by simulating devices for testing mobile code, puts a significant demand on the computer and its memory. With this in mind, and considering my leisure as well, I fulfilled a childhood dream of buying a famous Gaming PC.

I chose to get a powerful computer, albeit an entry-level one to reduce costs, but so far, it's serving me well for both professional use and my leisure moments, enjoying my favorite games. Not to mention, the biggest advantage of getting a desktop computer, among many other things that convinced me at the time of purchase, is the ease of upgrading it if necessary. As soon as I feel the need, I can easily swap out components.

Certainly, not everything is perfect. Despite these advantages, there's the downside of losing the mobility that a laptop offers. However, since I currently work in a home office model and if needed, my company provides a laptop for work tasks, it hasn't been a problem for me.

If you're curious, I can provide the specifications of my PC below:
