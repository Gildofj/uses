After using the Redragon Cobra V2 for quite some time, I can say that this mouse is a worthy successor, and perhaps even better. Since I prefer heavier and more robust models, it fits perfectly for both work and leisure gaming.

It features a finish that really stands out: rubberized sides and scroll wheel ensure a firm grip, while the switches provide a very pleasant tactile click. The mouse also has two configurable side buttons and a top button to switch between four DPI settings, which can be customized through Logitech G HUB. The RGB lighting doesn’t disappoint either, appearing on the front logo and on the strip in the center of the scroll wheel.

With all these details, it clearly feels like a premium mouse. And to complete the package, it comes with a removable 10-gram weight on the bottom, perfect for those who like to customize the weight depending on the task.
