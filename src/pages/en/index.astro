            This blog was created with the purpose of sharing my setup and
            improving my skills with some recent technologies. Currently, I work
            as a software developer, more specifically as a Full Stack
            developer. In my free time, I like to pretend I'm a gamer ðŸ˜‚. Thus,
            most of my day is spent in front of the computer, making my setup a
            crucial part of my routine. Additionally, I see this project as an
            exciting opportunity to track the evolution of my developer skills
            and my own setup. I would like to note that my inspiration to start
            this project came from the indie developer
